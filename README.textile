h1. MySystem

Part of the CLEAR project, MySystem is a system diagraming tool. Part of the goal is to be a light-weight javascript
component to be used inside something like mozSwing (?)

See the basecamp docs for the project description for "CLEAR":http://concordconsortium.basecamphq.com/projects/2939067/project/log

h2. Dependencies


Based on "WireIt":http://http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/
Which uses "YUI":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/

(note that currently all dependent libraries are included in this repo, should probably be fixed up...)
